## Implementation Notes

### Coefficient Sources
The ecosystem service coefficients, erosion risk factors, and other numerical values used in the KPI calculations are derived from:
1. Peer-reviewed scientific literature
2. International standards (ISO, IPCC, EU directives)
3. Established databases (TEEB, EEA, OECD)
4. Expert consensus from landscape ecology and environmental science

### Normalization
Many KPIs are normalized to 0-1 scales for:
- Comparability across different project types
- Integration into composite indices
- Clear interpretation (0 = worst, 1 = best)

### Limitations
- Some KPIs require site-specific calibration for maximum accuracy
- Air quality impacts would benefit from actual emission data and dispersion modeling
- Soil erosion risk would be improved with actual slope and soil data
- Connectivity calculations could be enhanced with species-specific movement data

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with actual atmospheric dispersion models
- Species-specific connectivity calculations
- Site-specific calibration factors
- Temporal dynamics (seasonal variations)
- Uncertainty quantification
