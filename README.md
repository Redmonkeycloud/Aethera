**🌍AETHERA** is an AI-powered platform for conducting fast, accurate, and transparent Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). Combining machine learning, geospatial data analysis, and emissions automation, AETHERA is designed to streamline the EIA process for governments, consultancies, infrastructure developers, and researchers.

> _Elegant. Ethical. Earth-conscious._

## Project Vision

AETHERA empowers professionals to generate complete, regulation-compliant Environmental Impact Studies in a fraction of the time, reducing manual overhead and increasing transparency through data-driven insights.

👤 Founder

AETHERA is built by an energy systems modeler and environmental innovator.

“_We believe that EIA processes should be scientific, fast, and accessible — not bureaucratic, expensive, and vague._”

> Built from Greece. For the Earth.

## ⚙️ Core Features (MVP)

- ✅ **Land Use Intelligence** via `gis_handler.py`  
  Automatically retrieves and processes geospatial data using GeoPandas, SentinelHub, and land registry APIs.

- ✅ **Automated Emissions Estimations** via `emissions_api.py`  
  Calculates sector-specific emissions baselines and projections using integrated databases and ML models.

- 🧠 **Impact Inference Engine (coming soon)**  
  Uses trained ML models to infer probable impacts on biodiversity, air quality, and human health based on land use and emissions profiles.

- 📄 **EIA Report Generator (coming soon)**  
  Outputs structured EIA reports based on national and EU regulatory templates.
